## üß† Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms:
1. **Selection Sort**: 
   - Finds the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted portion. It continues shrinking the unsorted section while sorting the array in place.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n¬≤)

2. **Bubble Sort**: 
   - Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process repeats until no swaps are needed.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n¬≤)

3. **Merge Sort**: 
   - A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into smaller sub-arrays, recursively sorts them, and then merges them back together.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)

4. **Quick Sort**: 
   - A divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the partitions.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) (average case)

5. **Insertion Sort**: 
   - Builds the sorted array one element at a time, by picking each element and inserting it into its correct position in the already sorted part.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n¬≤)

### Pathfinding Algorithms:
1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: 
   - A popular algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which may represent road networks. It works by selecting the least costly unvisited node and updating the cost of its neighbors.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(V¬≤) or O(E + V log V) with priority queues.

2. **Flood Fill**: 
   - Used to determine the area connected to a given node in a multi-dimensional array (commonly used in paint bucket tools). The algorithm starts at a node and "fills" all connected nodes in a specific direction until it can't proceed further.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the region to be filled.

### Puzzle Solver:
1. **Tower of Hanoi**: 
   - A classic problem involving three rods and a number of disks of different sizes. The objective is to move all the disks from the first rod to the third rod, following certain rules. This visualizer demonstrates the step-by-step movement of disks.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(2^n), where n is the number of disks.
